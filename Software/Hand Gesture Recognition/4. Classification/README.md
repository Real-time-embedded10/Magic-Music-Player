File "Model_Training.m" is used to calaculate weight gradient matrix and bias gradient matrix, which will be used in our final real-time program. In file "Cross_Validation.py", a method named Cross Validation is applied to test whether our feature matrix extracted is useful. To train the machine learning model, 160 samples of each gesture, totaling of 960 * 21 features, are selected randomly to input. The remaining 120 samples (20 samples per gesture) are used to test the trained model.

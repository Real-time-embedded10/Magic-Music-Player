Data Collection
--
When training the model, large enough samples are required. 
Samples of 6 hand gestures (forward, backward, left, right, up and down) were recorded,
and each word was played by 6 people with different ages and sexes, collecting a total of 180 samples of each gesture.<br>
Since it is more convenient to collect data by python than C++ (Every time changing the stored file name, you don't need to re-run `make` and then `./main`), this file was written by python.<br>
[Here](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition/DATABASE/Original%20Data) is the original DATABASE collected. <br>

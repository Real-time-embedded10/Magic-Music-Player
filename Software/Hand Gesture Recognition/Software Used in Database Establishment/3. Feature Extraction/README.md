Feature Extraction
==
For each gesture, 180 samples were collected, and for each sample, there are 30 * 6 = 180 data values which should be processed. 
To decrease the computational complexity, the feature extraction technique is implemented. <br>
In gesture recognition, the extracted features should contain relevant information from gesture input, 
which serves as an identity to be classified separately from other gestures.
A set of statistical features from time domain is derived from the data vector, and detailed instruction and explanation is at our [wiki](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/wiki/Feature-Extraction).

In file "Cross_Validation1.py", a method named Cross Validation is applied to test whether our feature matrix extracted is useful by using SVM (Support Vector Machine). 
To train the machine learning model, 160 samples of each gesture, totaling of 960 * 21 features, are selected randomly to input. The remaining 120 samples (20 samples per gesture) are used to test the trained model.
File "Cross_Validation2.py" is used to test whether weight gradient matrix and bias gradient matrix calculated are useful.

Magic-Music-Player
==
This project is aim to design a real-time gesture-based Magic Music System, capable of adding sound effects (including tone and/or volume) in real time using defined hand gestures.

Main Function
--
Export source from Mobile phone/PC; <br>
Equipped Control UI on mobile device; <br>
Change music tone/volume by gestures in the process of playing music.<br>

Hardware
--
Graphical User Interface: Mobile Phone<br>
Communication: Bluetooth Module<br>
Micro Processor: Raspberry Pi<br>
Sensors of Wearable Gloves: Accelerometer<br>
Speaker: Audio Player<br>

Software
--
Communication system to realize wireless connection bewteen mobile phone and respberry pi.<br>
Marchine learning model to classify hand gestures.<br>
Digital signal processing algorithm to process input song.<br>
(Maybe concurrent programming is needed to guarantee the response time.)

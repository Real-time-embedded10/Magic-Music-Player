Magic-Music-Player
==
This project aims to design a real-time gesture-based Magic Music System, capable of adding sound effects (including tone and/or volume) in real time using defined hand gestures.<br>

Our Work
--
A current circuit was designed, and it can obtain information about accelerometer output, gyroscope output and temperature stably. The basic component used was MPU6050.<br>
Here is the PCB Layout and Connection. <br>

A real-time sensor-based dynamic hand gesture recognition system in raspberry pi, capable of automatically identifying whether a gesture is inputted and then translating it in the form of text, is introduced. The recognition result will be used as control signal sent to pc to control signal processing. <br>
[Here is C++ codes](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition/Real%20Time%20Recognition%20System) that use Raspberry pi to recognize hand gesture in real time. <br>
Besides, a [DATABASE](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition/DATABASE), including 6 hand gestures, is established. <br>
Codes used to [machine learning model training](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition/Software%20Used%20in%20Database%20Establishment) and [model testing](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition/Software%20Used%20in%20Testing) are also avaiable in this Repository.<br>

<br>

This project's UI design contains two parts: [UI on the PC](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Digital%20Signal%20Processing%20and%20UI%20Design/PC) and [UI on the raspberry Pi](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Digital%20Signal%20Processing%20and%20UI%20Design/Raspberry%20pi).<br>
UI on the PC can work as a music player while receiving control signal generated by hand gesture to realize designed functions by calling defined libraries.<br>
UI on the raspberry pi is responsible for connecting to pc and sending signal to PC. owing to the coronavirus, UI on raspberry also helps to test the communication between PC and raspberry pi.<br>

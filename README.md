Magic-Music-Player
==
This project aims to design a real-time gesture-based Magic Music System, capable of adding sound effects (including tone and/or volume) in real time using defined hand gestures.

Introduction
--
**Main Function**<br>
Export source from PC; <br>
Equipped control UI on PC; <br>
Recognise Hand Gesture in real time; <br>
Change music tone/volume by gestures in the process of playing music.<br>

**Hardware**<br>
Graphical User Interface: PC<br>
Sensors of Hand Gesture: Accelerometer<br>
Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition: Raspberry Pi<br>

**Software**<br>
Marchine learning model to classify hand gestures.<br>

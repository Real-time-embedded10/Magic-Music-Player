[***PCB Design***](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Hardware)<br>
A current circuit was designed, and it can obtain information about accelerometer output, gyroscope output and temperature stably. The basic component used was MPU6050.<br>
Here is the PCB Layout and Connection<br>

[***Software***](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software)<br>
Our Software contains two parts: **Hand Gesture Recognition** and **UI Software Design**(Communication and Digital signal Processing).<br>

[*Hand Gesture Recognition*](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition)<br>
A real-time sensor-based dynamic hand gesture recognition system in raspberry pi, capable of automatically identifying whether a gesture is inputted and then translating it in the form of text, is developed. <br>
[Here is C++ code](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition/Real%20Time%20Recognition%20System) that use Raspberry pi to recognize hand gesture in real time. <br>
Besides, a [DATABASE](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition/DATABASE), including 6 hand gestures, is established. <br>
Codes used to [machine learning model training](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition/Software%20Used%20in%20Database%20Establishment) and [model testing](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Hand%20Gesture%20Recognition/Software%20Used%20in%20Testing) are also avaiable in this Repository.<br>

<br>
[*UI Software Design*](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Digital%20Signal%20Processing%20and%20UI%20Design)<br>
This project's UI design contains two parts: [UI on the PC](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Digital%20Signal%20Processing%20and%20UI%20Design/PC) and [UI on the raspberry Pi](https://github.com/Real-time-embedded10/Magic-Music-Player/tree/master/Software/Digital%20Signal%20Processing%20and%20UI%20Design/Raspberry%20pi).<br>
UI on the PC can work as a music player while receiving control signal generated by hand gesture to realize designed functions by calling defined libraies.<br>
UI on the raspberry pi is responsible for connecting to pc and sending signal to PC. owing to the coronavirus, UI on rasberry also helps to test the communication between PC and raspberry pi.<br>

DSP based on time-domain approach is used to realize changing playback rate in this project. The time-domain methods operate directly with sampled data, which is more straight-forward than frequency-domain approach. However, the frequency-domain provides more sophisticated sound modifications. So that, the frequency-domain approach will be tried in the future to improve the sound effect.

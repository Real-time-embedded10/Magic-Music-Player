The recommended power supply for the Raspberry Pi 3B is 5V2.5A ~ 5V3A. It is generally considered that 5V Â± 5% (that is, 4.75V ~ 5.25V)
is an acceptable voltage range, but exceeding (or almost beyond) this range is prone to problems. Although the power adapters all output
5V nominally, as the current consumption increases, the voltage will gradually decrease. If the voltage drops to a certain level, the
Raspberry Pi will be underpowered and cannot work properly.

When the power supply voltage or current does not reach 5V / 2A, the main symptoms of insufficient power supply of the Raspberry Pi are:
-There are corresponding symbols in the upper right corner of the monitor linked to the HDMI interface or the upper right corner of the
  system desktop.
-The main board's red indicator is blinking or off.
-The display flickers frequently.
-The system starts repeatedly.
When the above situations occur, although the Raspberry Pi will work, it will be unstable and even crash.
